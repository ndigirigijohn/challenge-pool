You got a list of items, where every item has a value and a weight. You got a bag that holds a maximum weight of X.
Write a program that maximizes the value of the items you put into the bag whilst ensuring that you don't exceed the maximum weight.
items = [ {id: 'a', val: 10, w: 3}, {id: 'b', val: 6, w: 8}, {id: 'c', val: 3, w: 3}]
maxWeight = 8
bag = ['a', 'c'] // solution
